Wireless church tower bell sensors using an inexpensive 433MHz OOK transmitter and receiver

This is a project for an electronics enthusiast. It's not a product but you are free to use the source code to develop your own solution, or indeed copy what I have done.

This project is for 11 bit encoder and decoder for cheap OOK RF transmitters and receivers.
The software is written in Arizona Microchip PIC assembly language for the p16f628 processor.
The software was assembled and flashed to the processor using a Velleman P8048 PIC programmer.
Please read the pdf in the repository for a full description of the project.
